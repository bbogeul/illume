In a world that\\'s increasingly social and open, mobile apps play a vital role, and have changed the focus from what\\'s on the Web, to the apps on our mobile device. Mobile apps are no longer an option, they\\'re an imperative. You need a mobile app, but where do you start? There are many factors that play a part in your mobile strategy, such as your team’s development skills, required device functionality, the importance of security, offline capability, interoperability, etc., that must be taken into account. In the end, it’s not just a question of what your app will do, but how you’ll get it there.\\n        <br>\\n        <br>\\n        <b class=\"red-text text-lighten-1\">Hybrid development</b> combines the best (or worst) of both the native and HTML5 worlds. We define hybrid as a web app, primarily built using HTML5 and JavaScript, that is then wrapped inside a thin native container that provides access to native platform features. PhoneGap is an example of the most popular container for creating hybrid mobile apps.\\nFor the most part, hybrid apps provide the best of both worlds. Existing web developers that have become gurus at optimizing JavaScript, pushing CSS to create beautiful layouts, and writing compliant HTML code that works on any platform can now create sophisticated mobile applications that don’t sacrifice the cool native capabilities. \\n\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nAt the end of the day, it doesn\\'t matter how an app or site got up there but what matters is under the hood. Our web and mobile apps are powered by Meteor, an innovative platform built on the backs of Node.js and furthering our imagination with Javascript. \\n  </p>\\n    </div>\\n                '), HTML.DIV({\n    \"class\": \"row callToAction\"\n  }, \"\\n            \", HTML.DIV({\n    \"class\": \"container\"\n  }, \"\\n                \", HTML.DIV({\n    \"class\": \"col s12 m10 l10 offset-l1 offset-m1\"\n  }, \"\\n                \", HTML.Raw('<h4 class=\" center rale grey-text text-darken-3\">\\n                    Got questions about our services?
