        <p>
          There are many reasons a project can be stalled. We do our bests to circumnavigate around these issues, but sometimes the problem can be out of our hands. We will be contacting you thoroughly to get any issues resolved.

       <h3 class="mont amber ">Change Course</h3>
        <p>
         If a project stalls, sometimes you the client might want to change course (maybe due to budget constraints, time variables, etc.) we will do our best to accommodate any changes to our project timeline. But many times a project stalls due to lack of contents being provided, and budgetary issues with our accounts.

        <p>
          Sometimes businesses do not work out. We do our best to avoid these scenarios as much as possible since we would like to think we built our business relationship on trust. But the world sometimes does not work the way we want and we might have to part ways.<br>
