    Hello there curious developer!
     
    Looks like you wanted to see how I made this website. Well, first off, my name is Joseph and I am web developer and designer
    working with a powerful application called Meteor. Unfortunately, this isn't the best way to see how I made this site
    but you can always go to www.github.com/bbogeul to see all my other work. My passion is to deliver websites and web apps that  are simple yet powerful BUT first and foremost: useful. I think there are a lot of great developers out there but one thing I can assure you is that I am a fast adapter to any new market and challenge. Besides, what is life without a bit of challenge, right? Check out what I can do and if you are interested in partnering up for 
    a project or interested in investing, let me know and we can find a time to meet up, call, or whatever
    is best for you. Coffee is on me.
    Cheers and paz! 
     
    Joe (Jaulz)
    
    안녕하세요! 저의 웹사이트에 대해서 궁금하신 것 같군요! 저는 프론트-엔드 개발자 이상준이라고 합니다 그리고 이 사이트는 미티어라는 강력한 node.js플랫폼을 사용해서 만들었구요. 아쉽지만, 저의 소스는 이렇게 못 보구요 궁금하신 점이 있으시다면 저의 깃허브 (www.github.com/bbogeul) 페이지 한 번 들려보시는 것은 어떨까요? 궁금하신 점 있으시다면 언제든지 연락주세요!
